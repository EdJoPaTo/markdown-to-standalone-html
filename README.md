# Markdown to Standalone HTML

This tool creates an HTML file from Markdown.
The HTML is meant to be standalone, much like PDF intends to do.
They also should include some basic Table of Contents in a simple HTML/CSS setup.

This is still work in progressâ€¦
Some things work, some things don't.

# Usage

```bash
markdown-to-standalone-html input.md > output.html
```
